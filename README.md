# CS361-ADV-ALGORITHMS-DATA-STRUCTURES---Homework04

In this assignment I revisted the Grade Calculator program developed previously in (Homework01)[https://github.com/kayt00/CS361-ADV-ALGORITHMS-DATA-STRUCTURES---Homework01.git]. Rather than storing the scores in a vector, our assignment was to modify the Grade Calculator using a map to allow the grades to be stored with their correct types to begin with. The `Load` function is implemented to fill the map, `m_Grades`, with grades. Then the `CalculateAverage` returns a pair containing the count and average for the provided grade type without a user-defined loop. The same command line parameters, grade weights, and file format from Homework01 were used.
